      <h1>What is Hoisting?</h1>
      <p>
        Hoisting is the default behavior of javascript which moves the variables
        & function declarations on top of the scope
      </p>
      <p>
        var, let & const all are hoisted but when tried consoling let & const
        before declarations JS throws error in the browser console. <b>Why?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        When we see in the browser console, the let & const values are assigned
        a special placeholder i.e. 'undefined' but JS is not able to behave
        (print) like that in the case of var as the let & const are in the
        temporal dead zone (TDZ) for time being though they are hoisted
      </p>
      <div class="ui info message">
        <div class="header">Temporal Dead Zone?</div>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>
            TDZ is the time when the let & const are hoisted till they are
            assigned(initalized) a value
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p><u>Let's see this with an example below</u></p>
      <div class="ui raised segment">
        <pre>
          console.log(x);
          console.log(y);
          console.log(z);
          var x = 1;
          let y = 2;
          const z = 3;
        </pre>
        
      </div>
      <div class="ui raised segment">
        Output
        <pre>
          undefined
          Referrence - cannot access 'y' before initialization
        </pre>
        
      </div>
      <p>
        <b>Why JS behaves different for var & let keyword</b>
        <p>Because JS prints undefined for 'x' as before initialization the JS
          assigns a special placeholder to var keyword & for let JS throws error
          because at present let are in the temporal dead zone (same behaviour
          for const)</p>
